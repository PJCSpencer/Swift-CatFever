# Swift-CatFever

# About
A small Swift 3 project I put together as an exercise to learn something about Appleâ€™s URLSession and related classes to make concurrent networking calls, closures and memory usage. It also implements part of a dynamic, compact, scalable data source.

# Installation
The project was developed using Xcode 8.3.1, Swift 3.
